Wrangling the data provided by WeRateDogs turned out to time-consuming and quite challenging than I had initially thought. It's easy to see how time-consuming it can be since I have spotted more issues that can be addressed. "

Afterward, I had to programmatically download the image_predictions tsv file, using the request library and the url that was provided. I accessed all the file content by using the `get` function on the url then wrote those content onto an empty file.  "

Therefore, I set up my application to link with my twitter account to get unique keys which can be used to create an API object. We were able to do this with `tweepy`, an access library for the twitter API. \n",

Every tweet's json object in the text file was read one by one into an empty list. Lastly, I extracted the favourite and retweet counts for each and every tweet and used their corresponding tweet ids to create a new pandas dataframe.\n",

I have found that most of the issuses are in the twitter_archive table which should come as no surpise since its the largest. The `head`,`tail` and `sample` functions are frequently used to visually assess each dataset. Others required a little more analysis, mainly through summaries or filtering out certain sections of the data. While prgrammatically assessing the dataset, the `info`, `describe` and `value_counts` functions were frequently used for this step."
