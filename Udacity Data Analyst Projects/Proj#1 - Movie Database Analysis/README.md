### Project
This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue and starting at year 1966. As a movie enthusiast, I am interested in exploring how the audience vote on movies over the years. This project is inspired by Youtube videos explaining "why modern movies are bad", arguing that the quality and creativity are deteriorating.
The movie dataset was provided by Udacity and is also publicly available in kaggle. The data includes information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
