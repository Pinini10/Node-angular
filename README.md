Data Analyst Portfolio
Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Malan Ouanga, and I’m excited to showcase my work here. In this repository, you will find several projects that highlight my skills in data gathering (via APIs), data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and presentation. The majority of my work is done using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Below, I’ve provided a summary of my journey into data science, along with a brief overview of the projects included in this portfolio. Let’s dive in!

About Me & My Data Journey
I am an IT professional based in Dallas-Fort Worth, with a deep passion for data analytics and cloud computing. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to solve complex problems. Currently, I am interning as a Market Consultant at Stiddle, where I create content for the company’s website, email marketing campaigns, and social media efforts. This role has also allowed me to apply my data skills by gathering and analyzing data to suggest relevant topics and identify target industries and locations for campaigns. I have recently transitioned into a more analytical role where I focus on analyzing the eCommerce market.

My journey into data science started in my home country, Ivory Coast, where I studied data structures and algorithms. I continued my education at Dallas College and the University of Texas at Dallas, earning an Associate degree and currently working towards my Bachelor’s degree. My interest in data was sparked after learning how raw data played a pivotal role in the Battle of Midway, ultimately turning the tide of World War II in favor of the Allies. Inspired by this, I pursued courses in statistics, linear algebra, and R. Later, I formalized my learning through the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree and more recently completed the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where I gained hands-on experience building Machine Learning pipelines and creating recommendation systems.

I am passionate about fostering teamwork and creativity in the workplace, and I am a fast learner with a quirky sense of humor. Moving forward, I aim to leverage my skills to grow my career in software engineering and cloud computing, helping businesses solve problems with data-driven solutions.

Projects
Proj#1 - NBA Data Wrangling & Exploration
In this project, I explored the offensive stats and characteristics of NBA teams, categorizing them based on Finals ranking (Champion, Runner-Up, Knocked Out, Never Qualified). The project involved data gathering through web scraping, data cleaning, and data exploration (analysis and visualization). The goal was to analyze team performance and discover meaningful insights from the data.

Proj#2 - Financial YouTube Data Analysis & Exploration
For this project, I analyzed several financial YouTube channels focused on the stock market. The main goal was to determine if factors like likes, comments, and subscriber counts have any impact on video promotion. I used the YouTube API for data gathering, followed by data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I also utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization to analyze video descriptions.

Proj#3 - London Crime Hypothesis Testing
This project explores violent crime rates in London, analyzing trends over time and seasonality. I worked with a dataset containing crime data from 2008 to 2016. The project involved hypothesis testing, statistics, and regression data modeling to determine when violent crimes are most likely to occur, including adjustments for daylight saving time.

Proj#4 - Beer Project with R
This project, completed for the Data Science 6306 course at Southern Methodist University, analyzes two datasets on beer and breweries to gain actionable insights for Budweiser. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), I used the KNN classifier to predict beer categories based on key features like IBU and ABV.

Proj#5 - Airbnb Modeling
In this Udacity project, I analyzed Airbnb data from Seattle and Boston to answer several business questions, such as:

What amenities are most important for Airbnb listings in each city?
Can I predict the price based on 8 features?
How does price fluctuate each month in both cities?
How does the total number of listings change month to month? The project involved data exploration, modeling, and visualization to provide clear answers to these questions.
Medium Article: Airbnb Listings Analysis

Proj#6 - IBM Recommendation System
This project involved creating a recommendation system for users interacting with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. The system was built using several techniques:

Rank-based recommendations: Identifying popular articles.
Collaborative filtering: Recommending articles based on user behavior.
Matrix factorization: A machine learning approach to predict new articles that users may engage with.
Proj#7 - Disaster Response Pipeline
In this Udacity project, I built a machine learning/NLP pipeline to classify messages sent during disasters into 36 predefined categories (e.g., Aid Related, Medical Help, Search and Rescue). This system helps route messages to the appropriate disaster relief agency. The project includes a web application to automate the classification process.

Udacity Data Analyst Projects
In this folder, you will find a series of projects I completed as part of Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree. These projects focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization. Below are brief descriptions of the projects:

Movie Database Analysis: I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to answer business questions about movie ratings.
A/B Test Analysis: I analyzed the results of an A/B test to help an e-commerce company decide whether to implement a new web page or keep the existing one.
Twitter Data Wrangling & Analysis: I used the Twitter API to gather, clean, and analyze tweets from a popular Twitter account, providing insights into the account’s engagement and content.
Loans Exploratory Data Analysis: I conducted EDA on a loan dataset, identifying relationships between variables and visualizing trends.
SQL Movie Rental Analysis: I used SQL to query a DVD rental database, conducting in-depth analysis on customer behavior and answering business questions using window functions, CTEs, and joins.
